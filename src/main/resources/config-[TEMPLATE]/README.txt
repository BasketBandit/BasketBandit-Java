Before I rewrite the way my configuration files work, it is currently a simple system.
All of the above configuration files contain only a note of what should appear on that line.

for example:

author
author website
help server url
bot-id
bot-token

should be:

John Smith
https://mywebsite.com
https://discord.gg/helpme
1234567891234
AÂ£%jfnamads$8Klso2m_amaam

LAVALINK:
THIS FORMAT CAN BE REPEATED FOR MULTIPLE NODES (no spaces)

ws://ipaddress:socket
password

API:
THE FORMAT FOR API IS api name/id THEN api key (keep them null if you don't want to use them)

null
null
